## A little bit about me...

I'm a Software / DevOps Engineer based in Sydney, Australia. A father of two and a passionate blue belt Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu practitioner. I'm currently working for a company to which we are strong advocates of Agile methodology. My development background has always been Java, but not limited to the following skill sets:
- Git
- Python
- Ansible
- Jenkins
- Gradle & Maven
- CI / CD
- AWS
- Spring

My blog will be based on my personal opinion, and what you see in my blog tutorials are something I wish to share based on my learning. I don't normally blog but I thought to myself that by doing this will motivate me further to learning. That said, feedback is always welcome! I hope you will enjoy my blog as much as I enjoy preparing it!
