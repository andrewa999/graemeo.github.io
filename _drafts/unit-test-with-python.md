## Unit Testing with Python

My development background has always been Java, and I wouldn't call myself an expert in Python.

For the past 12 months (at least) however, I have been fortunate enough to be able to build and maintain a bunch Python scripts. Thanks to the rise of DevOps mindset (or culture if you like).

As much as we enjoy scripting Python to build automation, one common problem that I have been noticing. The lack of unit tests or none at all!
